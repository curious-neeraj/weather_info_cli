# CLI Tool for getting Weather Info
It's not a bad idea to get an idea about the weather forecast for any day as it helps us to plan our coffee breaks according to the nature's mood outside!

Expectations :

- [x] ~~Basic CLI tool/command(s) to get weather forecase of current date | User should be allowed to pass location!~~
- [x] ~~Read data from making call to Weather API~~
- [x] ~~Organize data as per liking to get necessary info displayed when called~~
- [x] ~~Beautify the result a bit (optional)~~

Go to Have Add-Ons :

- [ ] Better Error Handling
- [ ] Extensive Logging
- [ ] Add Unit Tests (would be fun to add them here!)
