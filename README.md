# CLI Tool for getting Weather Info
It's not a bad idea to get an idea about the weather forecast for any day as it helps us to plan our coffee breaks according to the nature's mood outside!

Expectations :

- [ ] Basic CLI tool/command(s) to get weather forecase of current date | User should be allowed to pass location!
- [ ] Read data from making an API call
- [ ] Organize data as per liking to get necessary info displayed when called
- [ ] Beautify the result a bit (optional)
